At the end of the sampling process, it was found to be true 80.01% of the time, demonstrating that one million samples are sufficient to achieve a precise approximation. The same test has been executed on the unique multinomial random variable \"Insomnia\" with clamped parent values. The results of this test are not shown, but the precision obtained was of the same order of magnitude. <br>\n",
