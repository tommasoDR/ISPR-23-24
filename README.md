### Assignments list:
- Assignment 1: The musical pitch of a note is determined by its fundamental frequency. The pitch played by different instruments sounds different due to harmonics, i.e. other frequencies that are superimposed and determine the timbre of the instrument. The dataset contains samples from several instruments playing different notes. Plot the spectrogram for some of them (4 instruments are sufficient) and check if it is possible to recognize the different instruments by only looking at the spectrogram. In your presentation, discuss which samples you chose to compare, how you computed the spectrogram and whether the resulting features are sufficient to recognize the instrument.

- Assignment 2: Implement a Bayesian Network (BN) comprising at least 10 nodes, all with binomial or multinomial distribution. Represent the BN with the data structures that you deem appropriate and in the programming language that you prefer. The BN should model some problem/process of your choice, so you are also free to define the topology according to your prior knowledge.
Once you have modelled the BN, also plug in the necessary local conditional probability tables. You can set the values of the probabilities following your own intuition on the problem. Then run some episoded of Ancestral Sampling on the BN and discuss the results.
The assignment needs to be fully implemented without using BN libraries.

- Assignment 3: The dataset contains text of online travel reviews with an associated Rating. The objective is to train a classifier to predict the rating from the Review text. Train the model and assess it as appropriate in machine learning. You are allowed to preprocess the data however you want (e.g. using pretrained embeddings, dropping some features, just a bag-of-words), but the predictive model must be trained from scratch (no pretrained predictor).

- Assignmnet 4: This midterm is based on reading and summarizing the main findings of a single paper.
